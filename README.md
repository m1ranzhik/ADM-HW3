### *Interactive Map Visualization*

Due to GitHub's rendering limitations, interactive maps created using libraries like Plotly or Folium cannot be displayed directly in this repository. To overcome this, we have provided an *nbviewer* link where you can view our interactive maps and visualizations.

You can view the interactive maps and visualizations by clicking the link below:

### *REPOSITORY CONTENT*

*This repository consists a Jupyter notebook titled 'main.ipynb', The notebook is divided into two main sections:*

*1. __MICHELIN RESTAURANTS IN ITALY__ building a tool to enhace the user experience, and helping users discover and rank Michelin-starred restaurants across Italy based on their unique preferences.*

*2. __ALGORITHM QUESTION__ focused on robot packages collection with the fewest moves.*

*The culinary arts have evolved into a refined expression of creativity, with Michelin-starred restaurants exemplifying quality and innovation. Recognizing the need for a tailored tool for food enthusiasts, you and your team are developing a search engine to help users explore and rank Michelin-starred restaurants in Italy based on their preferences. This platform aims to deliver an efficient and user-friendly experience for discovering Italyâ€™s finest dining options.*

*This project is a specialized search engine for food enthusiasts, designed to help users explore and rank Michelin-starred restaurants across Italy based on personalized preferences. It offers an efficient and intuitive way to discover exceptional dining experiences, inspired by the Michelin Guide's commitment to quality and innovation in gastronomy. This is based on a data collected from [Michelin Guide website](https://guide.michelin.com/en/it/restaurants)* 

## *ALGORITHM QUESTION*

*This project implements a solution for a robot navigation problem in a warehouse grid. The robot collects packages from specified coordinates, starting at (0, 0) and moving only up ('U') or right ('R'). The solution determines if all packages can be collected and, if possible, provides the lexicographically smallest path for the shortest collection route.*

### INPUT

~ The first line contains 
t
(

â‰¤
t
â‰¤

)
 â€” the number of test cases.
 
~ Each test case starts with 
n
(
1
â‰¤
n

)
, the number of packages.

~ The next 
n
 lines contain the coordinates 
x

,
y
i
(

 for each package.

### OUTPUT

~ For each test case, print "YES" and the lexicographically smallest path, or "NO" if itâ€™s impossible to collect all packages.
